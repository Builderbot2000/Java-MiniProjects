# Java-MiniProjects
This repository contains several mini-projects using Java programming language that have been completed to gain practice and skill training.
# Cryptography
This mini-project is about the basics of cryptography, the science of keeping information private and secure. It contains cryptographic systems, which were used from the Roman Empire through the early 1900s, so these ciphers have been implemented, also implemented an algorithm for breaking them. 
The project involved not only string processing, but also, but also arraysâ€”a way to store an indexable sequence of elements. 
Skills gained:
- combine Strings using concatenation; 
- build Strings within a Java program using StringBuilder; 
- use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data; 
- refactor programs for improved organization using object-oriented principles; 
- and practice effective algorithm design.

The project was implemented thanks to the Coursera course [Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data/) from Duke University.
